I am an incoming Assistant Professor at the FinTech Thrust, HKUST (GZ). I received his Ph.D. in Computer Science from Nanyang Technological University, where I conducted research in the Agent Mediated Intelligence Lab under the supervision of Professor [Bo An](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/boan/). My research interest lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and financial technology, with a focus on reinforcement learning (RL) for quantitative trading. I have published over ten papers in top-tier AI conferences and journals, including NeurIPS, KDD, AAAI, WWW, and Artificial Intelligence. I led the development of [TradeMaster](https://github.com/TradeMaster-NTU/TradeMaster), an open-source RL-based trading platform with over 1.9k stars on GitHub. I have gained practical experience through internships with hedge funds such as Lingjun Investment. I was also awarded first place in the 2024 Citadel Datathon. Prior to my doctoral studies, I earned a bachelor’s degree from Nankai University and a master’s degree from the University of Edinburgh. I have also worked with Professor [Jian Li](https://people.iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianli/) as a research assistant at Tsinghua University.
